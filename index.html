            <p>Not so long ago, it was just a dream that was yet to come true and it was to become a web devolper. Learn Coding by knowing the coding language.But what comes first is I had a dream and it was bigger and to achieve the dream in the motive to make it a reality, I took actions. Now, I am taking baby steps towards my goals. One day if I work hard like this everyday, I will get success! I have to because hardwork always pays off! So, never ever be afraid of Dreaming, whether it's small or big!!</p>

            <p>My journey begin with the helping hand of programming hero under the assistance of sir, Jhankar Mahbub. He taught me a complete junior web development course. I learnt from him heart to heart. I memorised and imprinted all of his words in my mind. Not soon after that my journey with coding started and I never had to look back. I can also proudly say I'm a Programming Hero.</p>
